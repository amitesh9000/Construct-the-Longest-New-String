# Construct-the-Longest-New-String
You have x strings equal to "AA", y strings equal to "BB", and z strings equal to "AB". You want to choose some (possibly all or none) of these strings and concatenate them in some order to form a new string. This new string must not contain "AAA" or "BBB" as a substring.
